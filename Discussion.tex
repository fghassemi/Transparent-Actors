\subsection{Discussion}
We have summarized how policies are restricted as more aspect added to the Rebeca family in Table \ref{tab:Policy}. 

Decision points: 
Actor puts message in the Buffer.

putPolicy: Overflow, overwrite

selectPolicy: FIFO, EDF, SJF??, pattern matching with no need to a state variable, nonDet

takePolicy: pattern matching using a state variable

transferPolicy: after(t), wiring actors (LF) configuration

priorityPolicy: composition policies, like all messages sent then take
